# ptu System

This system is a ptu system that you can use as a starting point for building your own custom systems. It's similar to Simple World-building, but has examples of creating attributes in code rather than dynamically through the UI.

## Usage

# Also, it now plays JS DOS games

Create an Item for any game that you figure out the download link / commands to run from here: https://js-dos.com/games/
Enter the name that represents the file in the CDN such as `Horror Zombies-caiiiycuk`, and a command a `|` delimited set of arguments to launch it such as `-c | cd /game | -c | /GAME.EXE`

This will bind up the keyboard inputs (including F5 refresh), and exit doesn't seem to work in the current version of js-dos, so you'll need to refresh the page manually once you're done playing a game.
